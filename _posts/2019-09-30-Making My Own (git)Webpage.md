Before creating this blog, I did a decent amount of research on hosting platforms.  Given my budget, as well as limited experience with web development, I concluded that gitpages would be my best option.  My reasoning is better explained below. 
 
### Making a gitwebsite: 
Creating a gitwebsite is rather simple.  There are many *free* resources available online.  Personally, I believe git’s official guide is extremely useful:  

[github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
 
### What does GitHub pages offer?:
According to git’s official documentation – “GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.”  Essentially, “pages” is a simple web host for HTML/CSS files on your git repository.  GitHub allows for free static page hosting without backend ability.   
 
#### Pros:

Ease of access:  
Everything is hosted on github.  The Git repository has become an industry standard for version control.  While a personal HTML webspace has little use for track management, the principle of operating a single repository is extremely useful.  Git offers a means to access all blog webfiles anywhere on the cloud. 
 
Price:  
FREE
 
#### Cons:
Github offers no backend functionality.  That being said, GitHub pages will not run any code for you.  This means that web applications and related interactive content will never compile off a git server.  For my intentions (markdown), this static restriction isn’t an issue.


### Other Options:
That being said, git is obviously not the only option for personal hosting, and it should be noted that there are many other alternatives depending on specific needs, technical ability, and price range.  In the future, I would like to learn more about hosting a server on a personal machine.
