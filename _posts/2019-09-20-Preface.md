From August to December of 2019, I have been granted the honor and privilege of interning at NASA Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. 

The content here will, in foremost, be an anthology of my Fall term at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  Although this blog post certainly doesn't cover everything, I've written it to give an overview of KSC, my own work experience there, and any helpful tips I picked up along the way.  

I intend to use this blog as a developmental exercise for myself, as well as a point of reference for the future.  In addition, I hope this will be an excellent resource for any future or prospective intern.
