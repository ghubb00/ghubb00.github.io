Gregory Hubbard is a current second-year medical student (M2) at Eastern Virginia Medical School passionate about healthcare and medical education. I am particularly interested in the molecular and immunogenic basis of chronic disease. My current research focuses on the paracrine mediators of cellular injury and the immunogenic factors that preclude pathogenesis.
