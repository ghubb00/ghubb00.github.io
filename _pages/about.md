Gregory Hubbard is a current second-year medical student (M2) at Eastern Virginia Medical School passionate about healthcare and medical education. I am particularly interested in the molecular and immunogenic basis of chronic disease. My current research focuses on the paracrine mediators of cellular injury and the immunogenic factors that preclude pathogenesis.

* Study: Deep neural networks and modeling of cortical visual processing
* Poster presentation: UM REU Summer Research Ceremony 2019

<br><small> Summer undergraduate research assistant following the study of two different broad approaches for the understanding of cortical visual processing. Involved the analysis of deep neural networks in comparison to known aspects of the visual system. The direct application of this research functions to improve existing computer vision technology through biological mimicry as well as garner a greater understanding of biological visual processing as a whole. Worked in part of a multi-disciplinary research team combining fields of medicine with computer science and engineering. 
Individual research was presented at the University of Miami Medical School Campus in coordination with the REU program </small>
